	  "text": "Every project is different. I can take on small projects from creating simple HTML templates based on Figma design to big projects employing multiple people. Those include presentation sites, e-shops, internal systems (inventory management, billing system), APIs, and in some cases mobile applications. Each project has its content management system if possible. This is very useful for mobile applications since you don't have to publish updates every time content changes. I am interested in working on projects that have specific and distinct requirements. However, I do not work with WordPress."
