	<div>
		<p>My name is Tom Barbořík, and I am from the Czech Republic. I am 28 years old and freelances for 10 of them. I am communicative with a high emphasis on your needs. The first step is to always decide their meaningfulness and applicability and create your project's brief.</p>
		<p>I have 16 years of experience with HTML, vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and PHP programming. On top of that, I have experience in creating React, Astro, NextJs, Strapi, and Nette projects. I built a few mobile applications with Flutter but prefer React Native and Expo better.</p>
